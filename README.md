Our submission, Elevion, redefines brand-driven recruiting concept by integrating an AI-powered candidate engagement engine. During HackSeoul 2025, we developed key upgrades - an AI Avatar outreach module, calendar automation for event-based recruiting, and real-time engagement analytics. These enhancements improved response rates to over 90% and simplified recruiter workflows. This project demonstrates how integrating AI with community-driven outreach can transform outdated recruiting practices into data-driven, scalable engagement.
